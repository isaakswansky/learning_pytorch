# Computer Vision

good algorithms:
- CNN (convolutional neural networks)
- Transformers

## Convolutional Neural Network

- apply filter to input image (convolution)
- reduce size by pooling (e.g. max, average for a image region)
- (first 2 steps ma be repeated multiple times)
- flatten output and feed it into a feed forward net
